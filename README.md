SQL Capstone Project: Airline Database Analysis ✈️

This project involves the comprehensive analysis of an airline database to answer a series of complex SQL queries. The database includes tables such as Flights, Bookings, Tickets, and more, allowing for in-depth exploration of airline operations, customer behaviors, and flight details.


Project Overview:

This capstone project aims to showcase proficiency in SQL by solving real-world airline data challenges, such as identifying highest and lowest-paying customers, analyzing flight details, and tracking cancellations. The project demonstrates the ability to write efficient SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the airline dataset.


Key Features:

Date Formatting & Querying: Reformatting book_date columns to specific date formats and retrieving key booking details.

-Seat Allocation: Identifying the least allocated seat numbers in the database.

-Highest & Lowest Paying Passengers: Using SQL window functions to rank passengers based on total amounts paid, both for highest and lowest payers.

-Journey Analysis: Distinguishing between nonstop and return journeys based on ticket information.

-Flight Details: Extracting information about the longest flights, morning flights, and canceled flights, among others.

-Refund Calculation: Identifying customers eligible for refunds due to flight cancellations and calculating the refund amounts.

-Aircraft & Flight Insights: Analyzing flights using specific aircraft types, such as Airbus and Boeing, and filtering flights based on criteria such as range and cancellations.


Tools:

-SQL: Queries were written in SQL to retrieve and manipulate data from the airline database.

-Airline Database: Hosted database containing flights, bookings, and ticket data.
